      "The general idea was to create an application in which you can see information from different countries, using the external restcountries api. From it you can, among other things: search for countries, filter/order them and create tourist activities. For the filtering and sorting functionalities we did not use the external API endpoints that already return the filtered or ordered results but we had to do it ourselves. In particular, some of the ordering or filtering should be done from the frontend.",

By clicking on the recipe, you can access the complete ingredients and the step by step. Database with recipes, backend and frontend. The styles are minimalist because of the context in which the app will be used.",
